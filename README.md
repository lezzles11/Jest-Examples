# Jest Testing Examples :rocket:

![Testing](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lxia0rv3s1z678n/Screen%20Shot%202020-07-28%20at%2010.22.52.png?raw=1)

## Purpose :dark_sunglasses:

The purpose of this repository is to have a series of jest examples to reference to later. We write tests to save time, break complex dependencies, think about possible bugs

### Analogies :open_book:

      You are essentially a grammer editor for a book - you want to make sure that the book follows certain rules, so you write scripts that check for those rules.

| Frequency | Component         |       When to use        |                          Analogy                           | Complexity |            Library            |
| --------- | ----------------- | :----------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------: | :--------: | :---------------------------: |
| High      | Unit Tests        | Fully isolated component |              A sentence - does it make sense?              |    Low     |      Mocha / Chai / Jest      |
| Middle    | Integration Tests | Units with dependencies  |    A chapter - does it fit with the rest of the story?     |   Middle   |      Mocha / Chai / Jest      |
| Low       | End to End Test   |        Full Flow         | The entire book - automated script that executes the tests |    High    | Puppeteer (simulates browser) |

##### Common Errors

- [ ] Syntax errors (you wrote something wrong)
      E.g., Code language - not closing bracket / quotes

```
console.log("hello)
```

- [ ] Runtime errors (the code fails)
      e.g., If the method does not exist, and you try to call a method

```
// if the method printMe does not exist...
window.printMe()
```

- [ ] Semantic errors (logical errors )
      e.g., the logic does not makes sense / not accurate

```
if (player === "green") {
    console.log("red")
}
```

##### Good practices

- [ ] Print out a cheatsheet of how to debug!
- [ ] console.log EVERY STEP (what did you expect it to output?)
- [ ] Use typeof to check type of variable
- [ ] debugger;

##### What should I test?

| Done? | Component                 | Priority | Estimated Time | Actual Time |
| ----- | ------------------------- | :------: | :------------: | :---------: |
|       | Data (look at pizza.json) |    H     |     1 hour     |             |
|       | Server                    |          |                |             |
|       | HTTP Requests             |          |                |             |
|       |                           |          |                |             |

#### Jest

Key things to know

- [ ] Jest will test files that have the .test.js or .spec.js extension
- [ ] Jest will also test all files under the \_ _ tests _ \_ directory

- [ ] Export the function you are trying to run

```
exports.generateText = (name, age) => {
  // Returns output text
  return `${name} (${age} years old)`;
};

```

- [ ] Create a .test file (and import the file) Import in the traditional way (example below )

```
// Can pull out some objects
const { generateText } = require("./util");

// explain what you are trying to test here
test("should output name and age", () => {
  const text = generateText("Lesley", 25);
  expect(text).toBe("Lesley (25 years old)");
});
```

- [ ] Change the scripts in package.json

```
"test": "jest"
```

- [ ]

| Done? | Method            |               When to use                |                            How to use                            |         File          |
| ----- | ----------------- | :--------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------: |
|       | toMatchSnapshot() | To make sure UI does not randomly change | It takes the UI component, and thenc ompares it to the reference | Look at pizza.test.js |
|       |                   |    Callbacks, Async, Await, Promises     |          [Docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/asynchronous)          |                       |
|       |                   |                                          |                                                                  |                       |

- [ ] The describe keyword helps to provide a better structure to test cases

```
describe("My first Jest Test specifications, sum", () => {
  test("adds 1 + 2 to equal 3", () => {
    expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
  });

  test("adds 5 + 5 to equal 10", () => {
    expect(sum(5, 5)).toBe(10);
  });
});

```

- [ ] To only execute one test, do test.only("") instead of test("")
