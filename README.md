# Jest Testing Examples :rocket:

## Purpose :dark_sunglasses:

The purpose of this repository is to have a series of jest examples to reference to later.

### Analogies :open_book:

- [ ] The describe keyword helps to provide a better structure to test cases

```
describe("My first Jest Test specifications, sum", () => {
  test("adds 1 + 2 to equal 3", () => {
    expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
  });

  test("adds 5 + 5 to equal 10", () => {
    expect(sum(5, 5)).toBe(10);
  });
});

```
